\section{Git and GitHub}
\subsection{Repository Initialization and Commits}
I started with creating a repository on github and cloning it into local machine.
Then, downloaded the GitHub Actions related files from the assignment repo and copied it into my cloned repo.

After that , I created a test main.tex file to see if it works .
I first compiled it on my local machine and then used .gitignore to ignore those files created by MikiTex.

I also added a tag and pushed the commit into GitHub and the workflow seems to be working just fine.
\subsection{GitHub Actions for LaTeX Compilation}

As I wrote in the last subsection,I just copied and pasted it into my repo , so not much of challenge.
Before I did that , I edited the settings of actions to read and write, making sure that the action would run perfectly.

I also needed to know how to add tags. I searched it up and it did not contain anything concerning that would result in a bigger challenge later on.
